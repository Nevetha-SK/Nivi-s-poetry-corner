            <p>
                Humans are capable of turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. But, their minds can create the extraordinary, And I always search and long for that kind of things. Always. My mind usually wanders and ponders everything that it gets to know and I'm always waving a green flag for whatever it does. Seeing things, sensing emotions & appreciating it has always been a go-to habit of me. While my eyes starts to search for something which it hasn't seen it before, my mind already starts to dance in a world of it's own thoughts and phrases. When I started giving actual words to this, I got stuck in here. A beautifull prison made by me for me. People rather always appreciate the things they have, or find a way to make it last longer. No one should loose their beauty just because someone can't see it. I always feel different whenever I see my surroundings. The urge to trap them all in my little world of ink and papers increases and fires me up to be here. I think this is the beautiful meaning for a life that we have, To appreciate even the feather like things and make others to see it's beauty too. Admiration and appreciation are the key for writing and I'm Nivi, the author of the poems here and who appreciates the little things!</p>
